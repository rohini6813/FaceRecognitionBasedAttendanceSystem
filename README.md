#Face Recognition-Based Attendance System

#Overview - 

The Face Recognition-Based Attendance System is an automated solution designed to track attendance using facial recognition technology. The system captures images of individuals, processes their facial features, and maintains an attendance log based on successful recognition.

#Features - 

Automated Attendance Tracking: Uses facial recognition to mark attendance.

Database Management: Stores and retrieves attendance records efficiently.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and interactive UI for ease of use.

Real-Time Detection: Detects and identifies faces in real-time.

Report Generation: Generates attendance reports for analysis.


#Technologies Used - 

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Face Recognition

Database:  MySQL

Framework: Tkinter (for GUI)

#How It Works - 

Face Registration: Register faces by capturing images and storing encodings.

Face Recognition: The system detects and recognizes faces in real-time.

Attendance Logging: Marks attendance upon successful recognition.

Data Storage: Attendance records are saved in the database.

Report Generation: View and export attendance records.
